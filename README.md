# cpp_calculator
This repo contains my first implementation of a calculator application using c++ and Qt!

Note on published artifacts:
As of 4/7/2023 the published artifacts only run on a 64-bit Windows machine.

Known Bugs/Limitations:
* After performing an operation which triggers "ERROR" to be printed to the screen, selecting a digit will clear the screen and cause the digit to be ignored
* Size of input is not limited so overflow on the calculator screen can occur with enough digits in input or answer.
